### Microsoft 365 Live Event Guidance
Start at the [Virtual Event Guidance](https://adoption.microsoft.com/virtual-event-guidance/ "Virtual Event Guidance") for an overview of Live Events, organized by role. The [Live Event Technical Community](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/virtual-events-and-webinars/bd-p/TeamsVirtualEvents "Live Event Technical Community") is a forum on Microsoft's TechCommunity site moderated by MVPs to assit with Live Events and Teams webinars. The [Live Event Assistance Program (LEAP)](https://resources.techcommunity.microsoft.com/live-events/assistance/ "Live Event Assistance Program (LEAP)") is a basic consultation with Microsoft to help you more familiar with setting up and running a live event or be directly available during a live event to help if any questions or issues come up. [Live Event Reporting](https://aka.ms/TeamsLiveEventsReport "Live Event Reporting") is a Power BI report made by Stuart Rideout to aggregate Teams Live Event reporting.
