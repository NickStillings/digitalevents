## Microsoft Lists Resources
Microsoft Lists help you organize, collaborate, and share the information you care about. Microsoft Lists are modern SharePoint lists, they reside in SharePoint but have an improved UI and feature set. Create and share lists that help you track issues, assets, routines, contacts, inventory, and more.  In our workshop, we used the [Event Itinerary Template](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/list-templates-in-microsoft-365-62f0e4cf-d55d-4f89-906f-4a34e036ded1 "Event Itinerary Template") in Microsoft lists.
